# Hospital Readmission Analysis

Business Problem:
Hospital readmissions are a major cost and quality concern for healthcare organizations. This project analyzes patient demographics and clinical factors to identify high-risk populations and drivers of readmissions.

Dataset Source:
Kaggle - Hospital Readmission Prediction Dataset

Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau

KPIs:
- Readmission Rate
- High-Risk Patient Groups
- Clinical Drivers of Readmissions

Key Business Questions:
1. Which patient groups have the highest hospital readmission rates?
2. Which diagnoses and procedure volumes are associated with increased readmission risk?
3. Which demographic groups represent the highest-risk populations?

Key Insights:
- Chronic conditions such as Kidney Disease, Diabetes, and COPD drive higher readmission rates.
- Age is not a strong predictor of hospital readmission risk.
- Procedure volume does not significantly increase readmission risk.
- Length of stay is not a meaningful predictor of readmissions.

Deliverables:
- Cleaned dataset
- Tableau dashboard
- Business documentation
