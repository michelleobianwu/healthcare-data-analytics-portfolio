Healthcare Claims Analysis – OBGYN Practice

Business Problem:
OBGYN practices must balance patient care, operational efficiency, and financial performance. This project analyzes healthcare claims data to evaluate procedure volume, reimbursement trends, and revenue performance in order to support data-driven decision-making for clinical operations and practice management.

Dataset:
OBGYN Healthcare Claims Dataset (simulated healthcare claims data)

Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau

KPIs:
- Total Claims Volume
- Total Revenue
- Average Reimbursement per Procedure
- Top Procedures by Volume
- Top Procedures by Revenue

Key Business Questions:
1. Which procedures generate the highest revenue?
2. Which procedures are performed most frequently?
3. How does reimbursement vary by procedure type?
4. What trends exist in claims volume and revenue?

Key Insights:
- A small number of high-volume procedures generate the majority of claims activity.
- Certain specialized procedures generate significantly higher reimbursement per claim.
- Revenue concentration is driven by a mix of high-volume and high-reimbursement procedures.
- Understanding procedure-level performance enables better staffing, scheduling, and financial planning.

Deliverables:
